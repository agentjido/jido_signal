# When to Use Jido.Signal

Jido.Signal is designed to solve common challenges in distributed and event-driven systems. Here are the primary use cases where it excels:

## Decoupling Services

Use Jido.Signal when you need to reduce tight coupling between components:

- **Microservices Communication**: Enable services to communicate without direct dependencies
- **Module Isolation**: Keep different parts of your application loosely coupled
- **Plugin Architecture**: Build extensible systems where components can be added/removed dynamically

## Agent-to-Agent Communication

Perfect for multi-agent systems where autonomous components need to coordinate:

- **Distributed AI Systems**: Enable agents to share information and coordinate actions
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Chain together different processing steps
- **Event-Driven Automation**: Trigger actions based on system events

## Building Observable Systems

Gain visibility into your system's behavior:

- **Audit Trails**: Track every action and decision in your system
- **Debugging Complex Flows**: Understand how data flows through your application
- **Performance Monitoring**: Measure and optimize system performance
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate reports for regulatory requirements

## Event Sourcing Patterns

Implement event sourcing and CQRS architectures:

- **State Reconstruction**: Rebuild application state from events
- **Temporal Queries**: Query your system's state at any point in time
- **Event Replay**: Reprocess events to fix bugs or add new features
- **Read Model Projection**: Build optimized views from event streams

## Real-Time Applications

Handle time-sensitive operations:

- **Live Updates**: Push changes to connected clients in real-time
- **Notification Systems**: Deliver alerts and messages instantly
- **Collaborative Features**: Synchronize state across multiple users
- **IoT Data Processing**: Handle high-volume sensor data streams

## Integration Scenarios

Connect with external systems:

- **Webhook Processing**: Handle incoming webhooks from third-party services
- **API Gateway Events**: Process and route API requests
- **Legacy System Integration**: Bridge old and new systems
- **Third-Party Service Coordination**: Orchestrate calls to external APIs

Choose Jido.Signal when you need a robust, scalable foundation for event-driven architecture that grows with your application's complexity.
