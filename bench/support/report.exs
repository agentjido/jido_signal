      "Timing runs without tracing or memory sampling. Setup, result checks, delivery drains, and cleanup are outside each timed interval.",

      "Observed memory maxima use start, setup, result, and completion barriers. Short allocations can be missed. Resource samples include setup and result checks.",
      "Process memory and heap include the caller and its traced descendants. Shared binary bytes count each observed off-heap reference once. ETS and application-owned Registry memory are excluded.",
      "VM memory includes the observer, loaded code, and unrelated activity. It does not establish ownership or leaks.",
      "Helper starts follow spawn traces from the measured caller. Existing application processes and the observer are excluded.",
      "Cleanup uses trace-delivery barriers and process monitors. Failed resource probes stop observed descendants before returning the failure.",
      "Flat and copied heap sizes exclude off-heap binary payloads. External bytes measure Erlang term encoding, not process-copy cost. Receiver memory includes process overhead.",
      "Retained terms are fixture inputs: attributes, Signals, encoded data, Routers, or event batches. They are not the full live Bus state.",
      "Async PID dispatch measures send completion. Original bus/fanout uses one mailbox. Extended fanout and concurrent publication wait for independent consumers. Checkpoint Signals confirm complete delivery after timing.",
      "Each Bus sample starts with controlled state. Sustained publication uses 64 batches on one full log. Backlog cases hold or release a consumer with explicit messages; no sleep controls consumer speed.",
      "Replay setup fills the log outside timing. Reconnect setup stops the old consumer before timing. Reconnect timing includes attachment, receipt, acknowledgement, and one-record delivery guards. Timeout timing includes the configured 2 ms wait.",
      "Mailbox counts sum queued messages at observation barriers. They are not an exact maximum. Slow-consumer publication deliberately retains its queue until the result check.",
      "Network adapters, external storage, VM restart recovery, and a complete failure matrix remain outside this suite. Telemetry has no benchmark handlers.",
      "Ratios alone do not establish a speed improvement. Repeat on the same idle host and runtime. Optional comparison budgets enforce time and observed-memory ratios; CI enforces portable fixture growth limits without a fixed timing threshold."
